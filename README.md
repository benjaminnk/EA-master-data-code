The EA team has developed a script to build its master dataset that includes quarterly MER targets/results. The following scripts assist with each step in building that:

1. COP FASTR-To pull data from COP FASTs and datapacks to create a data set
2. Initiative_Clean-to create a dataset from the initiative tab in the FASTs
3. MSD_Clean &FSD_Clean: Scripts for reading, cleaning, and binding the MER Structured Dataset and newly realeased PEPFAR Financial Structured Dataset
